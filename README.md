# FEniCSx-for-NS
Currently it consist of a working version of incompressible NS with stabilizing terms but the results obtained are not accurate.

This code used the basic frame work from https://github.com/chennachaos/CFDwithFEniCSx/blob/main/cylinder2D/Cylinder2D-NS-coupled.py and mesh setup and validation check from https://jsdokken.com/dolfinx-tutorial/chapter2/ns_code2.html.
